Motivation 

[Please describe the motivation behind your project.]

The large flexibility of creating stories and posts on instagram may leave social media users not knowing what to do in order to retain audience and curate the best posts for their audience. 

As such, the utilisation of our application will allow them to monitor their metrics in a dashboard and allow them to understand their audience better, giving the users suggestions on how to produce an effective strategy for successful content.


 

Aim 

[Please describe what you aim to achieve.]

We hope to make content planning and management more convenient and optimal for boosting growth for Instagram users.

As a content creator who wants to popularise my content to a wider audience, I want to be able to quickly identify current trends and be suggested content ideas.
As a small content creator without a professional social media management team, I want to be able to manage my social media platforms with minimal costs.
As a content creator, I want to be able to monitor interactions with my followers to create a tight-knit community.

# Next Starter Kit


A boilerplate for creating new projects with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, Prettier, Jest, and React Testing Library. Bootstrapped with [create-next-app](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app).
<br>
<br>

```

It will create a new directory inside the current folder.<br>
Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies:

```
 my-app
 ┣ public
 ┃ ┣ fonts
 ┃ ┣ img
 ┣ src
 ┃ ┣ components
 ┃ ┣ pages
 ┃ ┃ ┣ _app.tsx
 ┃ ┃ ┗ index.tsx
 ┃ ┗ styles
 ┃ ┃ ┗ tailwind.css
 ┣ .babelrc
 ┣ .eslintrc.json
 ┣ .gitignore
 ┣ .prettierrc
 ┣ README.md
 ┣ jest.config.js
 ┣ next-env.d.ts
 ┣ package.json
 ┣ postcss.config.js
 ┣ tailwind.config.js
 ┣ tsconfig.json
 ┗ yarn.lock
```

Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder:

```sh
cd next-starter-kit
```

Inside the newly created project, you can run some commands:

#### `yarn dev`

Runs `next dev` which starts the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

#### `yarn build`

Runs `next build` which builds the application for production usage

#### `yarn start`

Runs `next start` which starts a Next.js production server

#### `yarn lint`

Runs the `eslint` command for all files with the `js`, `ts`, `jsx`, and `tsx` extensions. See the `.eslint.json` file for all configuration settings.

#### `yarn lint:fix`

Runs the `eslint` command with the `--fix` flag which tries to automatically fix linting problems.

#### `yarn lint:cache`

Runs the `eslint` command with the `--cache` flag which only checks the changed files.

#### `yarn lint:format`

Runs Prettier which formats all files inside the `src` directory based on the configuration set inside the `.prettierrc` file.

#### `yarn type-check`

Runs the `tsc` command to compile the project and check if it has type errors.

#### `yarn test`

Runs the `jest` command which runs all tests

#### `yarn test:watch`

Runs the `jest` command with `--watch` flag which runs all tests in watch mode

#### `yarn test:coverage`

Runs the `jest` command with `--coverage` flag which indicates that test coverage information should be collected and reported in the output.
